    **Methods

      Methods are of two types: class methods and instance methods

        ***Class methods: Methods wich are defined for a class are class methods

        ***Instance methods: Methods wich are defined for objects are instance methods

      Let's look at an example. Let there be a 'Bike' class and 'bike1' be an object of it.
      Now, a method 'is_checked' defined in the Bike class to return the checked condition of all the objects of the 'Bike' class is a CLASS METHOD.
      Another method 'get_model' is defined only for the the 'bike1' object to get the model number is an INSTANCE METHOD.

    **Inheritance

        Many times we make a subclass of a class itself. The class whose subclass had been made is called superclass.
        All shown methods and attributes of superclass will be shown by its subclass also.
        And subclass may have some different attributes in addition to those as well.
        Other names of superclass and subclass are base class and derived class respectively.
