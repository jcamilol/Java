 Operators

The operators that provide Java can be classified as follows:

    Arithmetic Operators
    Relational Operators
    Increment and Decrement Operators
    Logical Operators
    Assignment Operators

    **Arithmetic Operations

    Arithmetic operators in Java are the same that are used in algebra, which are "+", "-", "*", "/" and "%"

    **Relational operators

    Following are the relationship operators in Java which return true if the relationship is true and false if the ralationship is false: "==", "!=", ">", "<", ">=" and "<="

    **Logic operators

    The logic operators in Java are "&&", "||" and "!" which designes "and", "or" and "not" respectively

    In Logical And (&&) operator, if any one of the expressions is false, the condition is false, the condition becomes false. Therefore, for the condition become true, both condition must be true.

    For Logic Or (||) operator, the condition is false only when both the expressions are false. If any one expression is true, the condition returns true.

    Logical Not (!) operator converts true to false and vice versa.

    **Assignment operators

    Java provides the following assignment operators which values from its right side operands to its left side operands

    = , += , -= , *= , /= , %= . For example, A%=B is given as A=A%B, etc.

    **Increment and Decrement Operators

    ++ and -- are called increment and decrement operators respectively

    ++ adds 1 to the operand whereas -- substracts 1 from the operand

    In a++ and a--, ++ and -- are used as "postfix" whereas in ++a and --a, ++ and -- are used as "prefix"

       ***Difference between Prefix and Postfix

       The Prefix operand first increases the value of the operand and then ruturn the value, while the Postfix operand first return the value of the operand and then increases it.

    **Let's import maths

    For maths functions, include Math class, under the package java.lang

    "Import java.lang.*;" imports all the classes of java.lang package

    "Import java.lang.Math;" import only tha Math class of java.lang package
