//////////////////
 Array of objects
//////////////////

    (c√≥digo anexo: array_of_objects.java)

    Let's go through this code.
    Car[] c; - This line declares that c is an array of 'Car'.
    c = new Car[10] - This line will create an array 'c' of 10 elements of class 'Car'.

    Here, only an array is created and not objects of 'Car'. To create an object, we need to use the 'new' operator with the 'Car' class.
    c[0] = new Car(800,111); - This line will create an object of 'Car' on 0th element of the array 'c' and assign 800 to power and 111 to serial_no of this object.
