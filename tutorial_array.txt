 Array

    An array is a collection. In java, an array is a collection of similar things. An array of int will contain only int, an array of double will contain only double, etc.
    
    **Why array?

    **Declaration of array

        int[] z = new int[10];

        Normally, we declare and assign a value to a variable as follows:

            int x;
            x = 50;

        For an array we do the same as follows

            int[] z = new int[10];
            z[0] = 50;

        If we know the elements of an array, then we can also declare the array and assign values to the its variables as follows:

            int[] x = {23,32,15,47,12};

        java has a predefined function to get the lenght of an array (number of elements in an array), which is "name of array".length

    **For-each loop

        The For-each loop is used to iterate over an array.

    **2D arrays

        2-dimensional arrays are generally knows as matrix. There consist of rows and colums

    **Declaration of 2D array

        We define 2-dimensional arrays as follows:

            int[][] a = new int[i][j];

            where i indicates the number of rows and colums the number of colums (both begining in 0)

        Now let's assign values to the elements of the 2-dimensional array.
    
    **Initializacion of 2D array

        We can assign values to a 2-dimensional array in the same way we assign values to a 1-dimensional array.

        In the first way, just assign a value to the elements of the array.

        Suppose we declare a matrix a[2][2]. After declaring it, we assign its elements as follows: 

            int[][] a = new int[2][2];
            a[0][0] = 1;
            a[0][1] = 2;
            a[1][0] = 3;
            a[1][1] = 4;

        The second way is to delare and assign values at the same time where each inner curly bracket represent one row:

            int a[2][2] = {
                {1,2},
                {3,4}
            };
