    A method wich name is the same that the class name is called "constructor".
    This method will be executed when objects of the class are created.
    private is a modifier that restrict the direct use of the variable outside the class.

    **Let's sum up these things

        class Student - defining a class whose name is 'Student'
        public Student(){ } - constructor
        private String - private restricts the use of variable 'name' outside the 'Student' class directly.
        public void setName() and public String getName() - Two methods
        public static void main(String []args){} - main method ( will be executed first )
        Student a = new Student(); - make object 'a' of 'Student' class.
        a.setName - calling method 'setName' of 'Student' class over object 'a'.

    **Constructor having some parameters

    **Returning and pasing object in a method

    If there is no constructor in a class, the compiler automatically creates a default constructor

        Suppose we made a class Vehicle without any constructor, then automatically its constructor will be created with nothing in its body as follows

        class Vehicle{
            Vehicle(){}
        }

    **Use of static

        'static' is used to make access to any data variable or method without making an object of that class.
        If a method is static we directly use it on the class, without making any object of it.
