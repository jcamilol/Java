*Explaining the "Hello World program":

**class Hello
	Hello is just the name of a class. For execute we need also the type of the class (i.e. <java Hello>)

**public static void main(String[] args)
	It is the main method. For all codes, the main method is executed first. So, it's not able to execute a code without the main method

**System.out.print()
	 print is a function which is available in System directory. It is used to display something on the screen
