 Input by user
///////////////

    In java we input with the help of the "Scanner" class. This "Scanner" class is found in "java.util" package.
    Afer impoting we need to write the following statement in our porgram:
        
        Scanner s = new Scanner (System.in) 

    Here by writing Scanner s, we are declaring s as an object of Scanner class.
    System.in whitin brackets tells Java that this will be System Input i.e. input will be given to the system.

    **How to input

        Consider the following code to take a value from a user:

        int n;
        n = s.nextInt () // s is an object of the Scanner class

        Statement n = s.nextInt() is used to input the value of an integer variable 'n' from the user.
        Here, nextInt() is a method of object s of the Scanner class.

        Similarly, we can input values of other data types also. Same as nextInt() is used to input an integer value, methods to input values of other data types are listed below

        METHOD       |    INPUT         
        nextInt()      Integer
        nextFloat()    Float   
        nextDouble()   Double
        nextLong()     Long
        nextShort()    Short
        next()         Single word
        nextLine()     Line of Strings
        nextBoolean    Boolean
